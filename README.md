The JavaScript Quiz App is an impressive showcase of your programming skills, creativity, and user-centric design. This project demonstrates your ability to create an interactive and educational experience that engages users in a fun and informative way. By combining JavaScript for interactivity, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling, you've crafted a dynamic web application that challenges users' knowledge and provides instant feedback.


1. Multiple Choice Questions: You've formulated a diverse range of multiple-choice questions that cover various topics or subjects of your choice. This showcases your ability to create dynamic content within the app.

2. Countdown Timer: The addition of a countdown timer for each question intensifies the experience, challenging users to think quickly and make informed choices.

3. Answer Validation: Through JavaScript logic, you've implemented real-time answer validation. Once a user selects an option, the app immediately indicates whether the choice was correct or incorrect, fostering instant feedback and learning.

4. Score Tracking: The quiz app displays a running total of the user's score as they progress through the questions. This feature adds a layer of gamification and encourages users to strive for a higher score.

5. Results Page: At the end of the quiz, users are presented with a results page that includes their final score and a summary of correct and incorrect answers. This feature provides closure to the experience and allows users to review their performance.
